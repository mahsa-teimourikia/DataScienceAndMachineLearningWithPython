# Data Science and Machine Learning With Python
Here I want to share the little projects and excercises that I do to experiment with Python in Data Science and Machine Learning. The codes are written by me, however, I have used materials and tutorials that I could find online (I will reference them whenever possible). 

Some good courses and materials that are really helpful to start the machine learning and data science in python are the following:

- Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp course in Udemy
- Data Science Foundations: Python Scientific Stack course in Linkdin Learning
- Data Science specialization in Coursera
- The book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, legal free copy can be found at: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf
- Model selection reference: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
- This list will be updated...
