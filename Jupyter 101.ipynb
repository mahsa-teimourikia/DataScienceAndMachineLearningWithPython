It's a very powerful way to work since you'll find your errors very soon after you write them, which makes it easier to fix them.

However, this runs the notebook in its current state. So, if I define a variable in a cell and then delete the cell, Jupyter still remembers this variable. This is why I prefer the more aggressive method of kernel restart and run all. The kernel is the background Python process that Jupyter speaks to. There's one per notebook. If you restart it, the notebook starts from a clean slate. \n",
